About Me

I studied mechanical engineering at Budapest University of Technology and Economics. 
After graduation, I started my career at an international engineering contracting company. 
2 years later, I was delegated to expatriate services to build and lead the sales application team in China, 
where I gained additional 6 years of valuable sales and application engineering experience.

In 2008, besides my day job, I started trading stocks and options on U.S. markets as a hobby. 
I was an engineer by day and a hobby trader at night.

At the time I used VBA codes for many kinds of tasks. 
As an engineer I automated engineering calculations, 
while as a trader I created small macros for data crunching, analysis and visualization.

In 2014, I resigned from the company and turned my trading hobby into a full-time job. 
As I switched from ‘hobby mode’ to ‘business mode’ I realized that Excel and VBA is not that efficient 
to make intensive calculations on large data sets. I had to find other programming language 
that had extensive libraries especially for web harvesting, data manipulation and data analysis. 
Python was a great choice…

Since then, I have developed many applications to support my trading activities, 
including tools for data collecting, data analysis, strategy building, machine learning and automation.
